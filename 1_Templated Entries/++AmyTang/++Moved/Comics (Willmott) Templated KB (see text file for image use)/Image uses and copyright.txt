I attached a different Krazy Kat strip since the original one was so tiny. I think that will be fine, since Krazy Kat's 
copyright has expired and is under the public domain in the U.S.

The other two images, Polly and her Pals and Tintin, are both extremely small and low-rez, which I think means that they
are allowed for use since their low image quality prevents them being pirated. I attached a Wikipedia link to Polly's image source 
on the templated entry that might help explain our position.
