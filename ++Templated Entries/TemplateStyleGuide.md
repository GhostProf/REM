##Doin' It: A Style Guide for Templating REM Entries 

This is a full list of all stylistic preferences to be used while Templating Entries for the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism. This list is apt to change and be updated often, so keep tabs on it, if you can. As we progress through the summer, more questions will arise, and the answers to these questions will be posted here. For additional information, you can check out the "Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism Template Guidelines" document, which is included in each editor's GitHub folder. This StyleGuide, then, gives further and more specific information on which guidelines and stylistic formats to follow when templating. Enjoy! Feel free to add to this list, but please do include your initials and the date beside your contributions to the list. 

###The Main Text



1) Should we separate each new paragraph with a space (i.e. a blank line), or simply indent, or do neither? 
*Single-spaced, with a double hard return (a blank line) between paragraphs.*

2) Should we omit, or include, comprehensive lists of the subject's entire corpus? 
*That depends on the length of the entry. For entries on the order of 1000-2000 words, the full list is fine. For shorter ones, selected lists are better.*

3) Should we, somehow, tag entries that we believe are poorly written? 
*YES! Suggestion (JJ): have "POORLY WRITTEN" at the beginning of the document name?*

4) For entries that are poorly written, should we use our discretion to revise them for greater clarity/flow, or should we just stick to correcting straightforward grammatical errors? 
*Edit freely. If you do extensive work, let me know and we'll have to send the entry back for final approval by the author. But many of the authors do not have English as their first language, so there will certainly be entries that have not yet been properly edited. The good news is that those will almost entirely be Literature entries. If you don't feel up to doing the extensive editing, note the file and let me know so I can do it or have someone else take care of it.*

5) Section headings are fine for longer articles. 

###Citations/Further Reading Materials

1) Should the "Further Readings" citations appear in the form of APA?
*I think the others have been doing MLA, and that's my preference. One key is to use the citation builder tool in Word.*

2) Should these citations include acronyms (such as UP for University Press)? 
*I am not sure this is critically important, but it is acceptable to use acronyms, so I have no issue with it either way. Let's say that for consistency's sake we'll go with UP.*

3) Should we try to track down missing information for these citations?
*Yes, please. If you can't find it, let me know and I'll email the contributor to ask for the details.*

4) Should we delete/convert in-text citations (where there is no direct quotation)?
*Even if there is no direct quotation, please leave the in-text citations but check that the work cited appears in the works cited.*


###About Visuals and Paratextual Materials

1) Should we use our discretion to select the best photo (if the contributor includes, say, eight profile pics of an author)?
*Yes. But don't delete the others, as permissions may necessitate using certain pictures over others.*

2) Do pdf files, as well as jpg files, convert nicely to HTML? Is one format preferable to the other? 
*Answer pending!*

###Dashes, Italics, ALL CAPS?

1) For Em-dashes, have a space before and after the dash, like — this, not like—this. 

2) Italics. Question pending?

3) If terms, names, movements, or any kind of artistic or intellectual works appear in ALL CAPS, they can be put into lower case. The all caps were an early stylistic tic when we thought it would be a good way to indicate terms needing cross-referencing.
