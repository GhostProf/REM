##A Style Guide for Templating REM Entries 

This is a full list of all stylistic preferences to be used while Templating Entries for the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism. This list is apt to change and be updated often, so keep tabs on it, if you can. As we progress through the summer, more questions will arise, and the answers to these questions will be posted here. For additional information, you can check out the "Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism Template Guidelines" document, which is included in each editor's GitHub folder. This StyleGuide, then, gives further and more specific information on which guidelines and stylistic formats to follow when templating. Enjoy! Feel free to add to this list, but please do include your initials and the date beside your contributions to the list. 

###The Main Text



1) Should we separate each new paragraph with a space (i.e. a blank line), or simply indent, or do neither? 
*Single-spaced, with a double hard return (a blank line) between paragraphs.*

2) Should we omit, or include, comprehensive lists of the subject's entire corpus? 
*That depends on the length of the entry. For entries on the order of 1000-2000 words, the full list is fine. For shorter ones, selected lists are better.*

3) Should we, somehow, tag entries that we believe are poorly written? 
*YES! Suggestion (JJ): have "POORLY WRITTEN" at the beginning of the document name?*

4) For entries that are poorly written, should we use our discretion to revise them for greater clarity/flow, or should we just stick to correcting straightforward grammatical errors? 
*Edit freely. If you do extensive work, let me know and we'll have to send the entry back for final approval by the author. But many of the authors do not have English as their first language, so there will certainly be entries that have not yet been properly edited. The good news is that those will almost entirely be Literature entries. If you don't feel up to doing the extensive editing, note the file and let me know so I can do it or have someone else take care of it.*

5) Section headings are fine for longer articles. 

###Citations/Further Reading Materials

1) Should the "Further Readings" citations appear in the form of APA?
*I think the others have been doing MLA, and that's my preference. One key is to use the citation builder tool in Word.*

2) Should these citations include acronyms (such as UP for University Press)? 
*I am not sure this is critically important, but it is acceptable to use acronyms, so I have no issue with it either way. Let's say that for consistency's sake we'll go with UP.*

3) Should we try to track down missing information for these citations?
*Yes, please. If you can't find it, let me know and I'll email the contributor to ask for the details.*

4) Should we delete/convert in-text citations (where there is no direct quotation)?
*Even if there is no direct quotation, please leave the in-text citations but check that the work cited appears in the works cited.*


###About Visuals and Paratextual Materials

1) Should we use our discretion to select the best photo (if the contributor includes, say, eight profile pics of an author)?
*Yes. But don't delete the others, as permissions may necessitate using certain pictures over others.*

2) Do pdf files, as well as jpg files, convert nicely to HTML? Is one format preferable to the other? 
*Answer pending!*

**Paratextual	Material**
* Each	entry	of	more	than	500	words	should	feature	illustrative	paratextual	matter	that	will	bring	the	term being defined	to	life	and	situate	it	in	a	fuller	context	than	text	alone	can	provide.	Such	material	may	include, where	appropriate,	video	clips	(of	the	person,	event,	performance,	or	adaptation), audio	clips	(of	a	person	reading, performing,	or	lecturing;	of	a	broadcast;	of	a	performance;	of	news	individuals, buildings,	posters,	scores,	blocking	of	scenes,	screenplays,	scripts,	instruments,	buildings	or installations),	annotations	of	any	images,	video	or	audio	embedded	in	the	entry	(using	a pop-out	format	that	allows users	to	trigger	the	annotation	by	hovering	the	cursor	over	a	part	of	the media),	and	interactive	timelines	and/or	maps.	
* When	submitting	their	entries,	Authors	should	include	permanent	URLs	for	all	such	materials	and/or	digital	copies of	the	relevant	files,	along	with	sufficient	description	of	the	material	to	allow	the	web designers	to	integrate	it	into		 the	REM’s	digital	environment	to	greatest	effect.	If	possible,	some indication	of	who	holds	the	copyright	on the material,	or	whether	it	is	out	of	copyright,	would	be	welcome	as	well.		


###Dashes, Italics, Spelling, ALL CAPS, etc.

1) For Em-dashes, have a space before and after the dash, like — this, not like—this. 

2) Italics. Question pending?

3) If terms, names, movements, or any kind of artistic or intellectual works appear in ALL CAPS, they can be put into lower case. The all caps were an early stylistic tic when we thought it would be a good way to indicate terms needing cross-referencing. 

4) UK	spelling	and	punctuation	to	be	used	throughout.	Please	use	the	Oxford	English	Dictionary	for	the	spelling. 

5) Writing	from	a	neutral	standpoint:

*Please write	from	a	point	of	view	that	is	as	neutral	as	possible.	Avoid	first-person	exposition	and	temporally rooted	formulations,	such	as	‘at	the	moment’	or	‘recently’.	Do	not	use	references	that	will	date very quickly.*		
		
*Avoid	inappropriate	gender-specific	language.	In	particular,	avoid	the	use	of	he	when	no	particular	person is intended,	either	by	using	he	or	she	or	by	repeating	the	noun	where	stylistically	appropriate.	In addition,	use human(s),	human	being(s),	person/people	rather	than	man/men	where	both	sexes	are	meant to be included. Use	layperson	rather than	layman.*
		
6) Simplicity/complexity	

*Ideas	should be	expressed	as	straightforwardly	and	clearly	as	possible.	Sometimes	this	will	be	at	the	expense	of brevity.	Theories	and	arguments	should	be	conveyed	as	simply	as	they	can	be	without	distortion,	and	jargon should	be	kept	to	a	minimum.	Where	it	is	necessary	to	use	technical	terms,	their	meanings should be explained.*			
		
7) Colloquialisms		

*Please	avoid	colloquialisms	and	informal	language,	including	abbreviations	such	as	‘it’s’	and	‘they’ve’.	Bear in mind	that	some	readers	will have a	different	first	language,	and	that	idiomatic	phrases	vary regionally and	are prone	to	obsolescence.*
		
8) Capitalization		 

*Please	keep capitalization	to a minimum.*		
		
9) Italics		

*Please	minimize the use	of italics	for	emphasis.*		
		
10) Scare	quotes		

*Please	avoid	using	scare	quotes	if	possible.	If	a	commonly	used	term	seems	clumsy	or	suspect,	preferably it should	be	reformulated.	Exceptions	may	be	made	only	where	a	term	is	so	prevalent	in	the	literature	as	to	need to	be	included	for	clarity.*		
		
11) Numerals	and	measurements		

*Spell	out	numbers	under	but	not	including	100.*		
		
12) Dates		

*After	each	biographical	entry	title	please	give	dates	of	birth	and	death. Where	the	subject	is	still	living,	use	a	double	hyphen:	Ellmann,	Maud	(1954–). In	historically-slated	entries	it	may	be	useful	to	include	lifespan	dates	next	to	each	individual	in	an	entry.*
		
13) Transliteration

*Please	contact	Routledge	if	you	require	a	guide	to	transliteration	systems. We	will	be	using	standard	
transliteration	schemes	for	Chinese,	Japanese,	Cyrillic,	Arabic,	Urdu,	Hindi,	Sanskrit,	and	other	languages	
with	non-Western	alphabets,	though	the	original	terms	will	remain	searchable	in	the	original	language, so	both	the	transliteration	and	the	original	should	be	retained	in	all	entries.* 

14) Foreign-language titles	

*The	first	time	that	a	foreign	title	appears,	and	there	is	a	published	translation	in	the	bibliography,	put	the translation	title	(in	italics)	in	brackets	after	it,	then	use	the	translation	title	alone	after	that	(unless	the	work	is so	famous	that	it	is	always	known	in	its	original	form,	e.g.	Baudelaire’s Les	Fleurs du	Mal, or	unless it	is untranslatable. Do	not	abbreviate the	titles of	works.*		
		
15) Lists		

*Numbers	should	be	used	for	lists	of	longer	items;	use	semicolons	between	items	if	long,	unless	they	are complete	sentences,	in	which	case	use	full	points.*	
		
16) Figures	and	tables		

*Please	ensure	that	there	is	some	reference	to	any	figures	or	tables	in	the	text.*
		
17) Law	references		

References to a case	should be	given	thus:	
							
*United States	v. One Book	Called Ulysses (1933)*		
							
References	to	legal	periodicals	and	reports	of	cases	should	be	given	as	follows:		
		
(a)	Case		
(b)	Year (in	which	the	report	about	the	case	was	published)		
(c)	Report/periodical	volume	within	that	year		
(d)	Report/periodical	name		
(e)	First	page	of	the	complete	case
