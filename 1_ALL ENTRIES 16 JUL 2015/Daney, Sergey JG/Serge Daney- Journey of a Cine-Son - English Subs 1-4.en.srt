1
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:06,416
Serge Daney, take one.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,561
RÈgis Debray: <i>Serge DaneyÖ</i>

3
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:14,439
<i>Serge Daney, you were born
in 1944.</i>

4
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:18,711
<i>We know you as
a moralist of images,</i>

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,252
<i>or a sociologist of the times,
I believe one of the best.</i>

6
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,242
<i>But we donít know you
yourself,</i>

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,860
<i>you donít talk about yourself
in your articles,</i>

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,581
<i>the times narrate themselves
through you.</i>

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,102
<i>And...</i>

10
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,529
<i>once you called yourself
a &quot;Cine-Son&quot;,</i>

11
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,205
<i>cinephile / cine-son,</i>

12
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:44,397
<i>as if the image has been
your ancestry, your family.</i>

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,327
<i>Can you tell us something
about the images</i>

14
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,073
<i>that looked at you
when you were a child,</i>

15
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:54,311
<i>and the way you looked at them,
as a child and a teenager?</i>

16
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,512
I think the first image
that counted for me,

17
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:01,057
almost the definitive image,

18
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:03,220
wasnít a cinema image,

19
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,714
it was the geography atlas.

20
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:09,570
I thought about it recently

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,989
and I realized that it was the image
that overlooked my childhood,

22
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,579
in the sense that at home
there was a map

23
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,773
which was
the map of the world.

24
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:21,641
Or the maps from school,
still very colonial,

25
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,223
all multi-colored,

26
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:26,773
with the idea that each country
is a different color

27
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,963
and the more names on the map,
the better.

28
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,499
I very quickly had an extraordinary
propensity to memorize names,

29
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:39,069
I think Iíve always known
the capitals of the world,

30
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:42,975
Iíve always known Honduras
was Tegucigalpa, always.

31
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,742
I canít remember a time
when I didnít.

32
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:47,841
All this to say,

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,887
that it was
the enigma of the map

34
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:53,181
that was the first image
that gazed at my childhood.

35
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,954
There were no images
at home,

36
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,639
there was no culture,
very few books.

37
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:01,891
The other formative space
was radio.

38
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,369
I am a child of the radio,
since there was no TV,

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,200
and still,
cinema came in third,

40
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,924
cinema was my mother
and my aunt,

41
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,003
especially my mother,
who would say:

42
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:20,381
ìOh, let's not wash the dishes,
weíll do it later.

43
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,028
Letís go to the cinema
and weíll take the childî.

44
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:26,109
And so quickly
I was dragged along, joyfully,

45
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,862
in the neighborhood cinemas
of the 11eme.

46
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:32,075
There were loads of those cinemas,
a good dozen.

47
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:35,996
And I went to see the films
that adults went to see.

48
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:40,585
The only favor they would do me
was to go and see swashbucklers.

49
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:42,210
I loved swashbucklers.

50
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,085
I didnít even realize they
were Italian then,

51
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,301
they were my favorite,

52
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,988
and my mother, of course,
preferred melodramas.

53
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,839
Actually, it was always Italy,
I realized later, much later.

54
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,576
So the formative,
in terms of images,

55
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,988
the fundamental image,
is the atlas.

56
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,524
So itís not a face,
itís not a portrait,

57
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,386
but it works as any true image,
like a face or a portrait.

58
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,012
Because any true image,
in the final analysis,

59
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:12,372
is a face,
and any face is a gaze.

60
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:15,647
So something gazed at me
from the geography maps.

61
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:19,024
I think itís very important,
Iím glad I thought about it recently,

62
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,869
because itís one of those questions
people often ask

63
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,295
and every one comes up
with their list

64
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:27,073
of the 10 childhood
unforgettable emotionsÖ

65
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:34,620
No, I think the first image was the map
in so far as it was a promise.

66
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:39,431
Itís a promise that I,
grandson of poor people,

67
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:44,131
born at the boundary between
the 11eme and the 12eme,

68
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,897
where I live now,
so really a Paris kid,

69
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:51,307
1944, in a terribly impoverished
and disqualified France,

70
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,219
profoundly disqualified,

71
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,828
where the Algerian war
will soon happen,

72
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,940
I have the feeling

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,001
-maybe now
Iím reconstructing a lot-

74
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:05,042
to have been the child of those times,
obviously Iím not the only one,

75
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:08,326
and to have developed
very slowly

76
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,638
my relationship
to what we call images,

77
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:13,344
especially cinema,

78
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:19,106
under the auspices of an image
more important than all others:

79
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,871
the geography map,
the small Larousse atlas.

80
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,169
And then later
the bigger atlases,

81
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,960
and when I could buy the most
beautiful atlases, I bought them.

82
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:31,288
And for me no map
was ever complete enough,

83
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,868
and as soon as I found a mistake
it was discarded, and so on.

84
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:36,789
Itís a childís thing,

85
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:40,911
itís a visual thing,
because the map isnít the territory,

86
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,789
as Korzibsky says.

87
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:45,500
But still,
from a certain point of view,

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,074
the territory looks
an awful lot like the map.

89
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:50,844
When you take the plane
for the first time,

90
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,499
you realize you could be
looking at the map.

91
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,957
And I believe that
the gaze of the map

92
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,912
upon me is programmatic.

93
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,482
Because it was always
the map of the world.

94
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:05,143
I wasnít chauvinistic.
Really not, from birth.

95
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:09,922
So the far-away countries,
the weird and complicated names,

96
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,639
the strange drawings
made by borders,

97
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:19,712
the names that changed,
when Urga becomes Ulan-Bataar,

98
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:23,087
I have the feeling that something
happened behind my back,

99
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:24,820
I'm rather furious.

100
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:30,037
So for me cinema is the same,
itís a promise,

101
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:33,275
a promise to be one day
a citizen of the world.

102
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,915
<i>Itís a travel that continues?</i>

103
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:38,940
Itís a travel that continues,
but itís mostly the promise of travel.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,854
Iíve travelled a lot,

105
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,873
thanks to cinema in fact,
film critics travel.

106
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:48,082
I also travelled
of my own free will,

107
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:50,697
out of fancy,

108
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:54,800
out of some kind of
mystique of the walker,

109
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,907
very fashionable
during the 70s.

110
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,909
But I get the feeling that
this promise was mostly kept,

111
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,611
because Iíve lived from it.

112
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,425
Iíve lived from
that world map,

113
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:08,965
itís only now that itís fracturing
and becoming politically obsolete.

114
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:12,287
Itís only now that I look
at the map of my childhood,

115
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,758
which in fact was Yalta
but I didnít realize-

116
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:17,115
<i>Now you have to take
the pre-1914 maps.</i>

117
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:17,846
Yes.

118
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,042
<i>Grandfatherís maps
are very good.</i>

119
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:22,686
Exactly.
My map has run its course.

120
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:26,618
Today, Iíve lost interest
in geography...

121
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:30,198
That's how I realize
a life has gone by,

122
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,729
because whether Croatians
are independent or not,

123
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,647
whether theyíre drunk on their
Croatian-ness leaves me absolutely cold.

124
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,705
That thereís a new country
with a new color

125
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:44,970
called Croatia or Slovenia
leaves me stone-cold,

126
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,200
whereas
when I was small,

127
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:51,539
really small, a new country
was like someone being born.

128
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,610
Whence the fact that it was
pretty easy for me,

129
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,227
as a kid, to be for
the independence of Algeria.

130
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,986
I didnít have the slightest trace
of a political idea.

131
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:01,605
It seemed obvious.

132
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,197
It was likeÖ

133
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:06,638
the more, the merrier,
and the more images there will be.

134
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,491
And anyway it doesnít change a thing
since weíre citizens of the world.

135
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,070
<i>And you can escape society
with images?</i>

136
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,094
<i>I.e. to find the world you have
to run away from home.</i>

137
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,806
<i>How does it happen,
this flight?</i>

138
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,238
<i>Is cinema a refuge, a protection
for the adolescent?</i>

139
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,062
Itís well before adolescence,
itís childhood, cinema.

140
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,504
Itís not adolescence.
Itís childhood.

141
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,706
Itís a much more intense,

142
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,213
much more
care-free feeling,

143
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,924
and much more serious,
of not being part of the world.

144
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,534
Or to only just be tolerated
by the world as it is.

145
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,448
And you know
by the age of 5,

146
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,977
like Duras
quoting Queneau

147
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,263
saying that a writer knows
he is one by the age of 7.

148
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:51,010
If he hasnít written by the age of 7
itís not worth pushing it.

149
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:52,589
Itís excessive, but true.

150
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:57,866
It means you know from the first time
you go into the courtyard,

151
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,601
on the first day
of primary school,

152
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:03,514
that there are people with
whom you wonít be friends,

153
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:07,187
and that thereíll be a group of 3 or 4
in a corner, the introverts,

154
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,334
maybe later, as for me,
the homosexuals.

155
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:14,876
In any case the cinephiles,
and they wonít share their treasure,

156
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:19,226
they know they belong to another
version of the world, or of humanity.
